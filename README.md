# Object-Detection-IITG-Project-
This is a project question given by IIT Guwahati for my 7th Sem Summer Internship
The question was:
#Object Detection: Develop a Python-based program that takes input as image
and detects common objects within the scene. The program should output the
same images with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects, along
with their class names and confidence scores displayed on the image.
Datasets: COCO
